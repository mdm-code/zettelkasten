# deprecation of go get for executables


+go +get +install +tool


The deprecation pertains to the way executables are installed with the `go`
tool. Previously, one would use `go get` in the same way one'd add dependencies
to a project. Starting Go 1.17, `go install` should be used instead to install
commands.

In Go 1.18, `go get` will no longer be used to build packages, it will only be
used to add, remove and update dependencies in `go.mod`.

To install an executable while ignoring the current module, use `go install` with
a version suffix (e.g., `@latest`) like this:

```sh
go install github.com/go/package@latest
```

This way, `go.mod` will not be read or updated in the current or parent
directory.

The reason why this change is being introduced is because `go get` was used to
both updated dependencies in `go.mod` as well as installing commands. This way
a source of confusion, since people rarely want to do both at the same time.

`go get` will stop compiling and linking packages by default, which will make
it faster. This means that `go get` will not be able to report an error when
updating a package that can't be built for the current platform.
