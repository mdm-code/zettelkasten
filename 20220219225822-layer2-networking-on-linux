## Bridges

You want to bridge two Ethernet networks when they need to be connected. Linux
can have two network interfaces that can be bridged with:

```sh
ip link set
ip link add
```

```sh
sudo ip link add br0 type bridge
sudo ip link set eth0 master br0
sudo ip link set eth1 master br0
bridge fdb show
```

The last command shows the MAC address table. Once Ethernet networks are
bridged, all the devices on these networks can communicate, at least at layer
2.

While bridging, you might want to avoid bridging loops that can bring the 
network down. You want to use spanning trees for that with `mstpd-ctl` that
stands for multiple spanning tree protocol daemon (MSTPD). Read more about
broadcast storms and feed-forward forever broadcasts.

There is no TTL (time to live) on Layer 2. TTL on Layer 3 causes packets to
be dropped once the number goes down to 0. It is decremented by one by each
router along the path.
