# What to do when you need a file I/O, but you don't want create one on the FS?

+python +stream +io +stringio

In Python---and in Go as well---there is standard library that will let you
create an in-memory file-like I/O to fiddle with.

Python has the `io` module that provides with convenient ways of dealing with
various types of I/O. Most of the time you'd happy with either Text I/O for
text or Binary I/O for the binary representation.

In case of text, you would create an in-memory text stream with `io.StringIO`
like this, for instance:

```python
import io

f = io.StringIO()
f.write('foo bar baz')
print(f.getvalue())
f.close()
```

In Vim, put your cursor on the first line of the snippet and type
!5jpython3<CR>. This is going to give you the output read from the in-memory
file.

With `StringIO` you can write to it and read back from it, but make sure to
move the curor with `.seek(0)` whenever you want to move back to the start of
the file.
