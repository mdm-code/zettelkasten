+sql +postgresql +postgres +database +psql

The best way to use PostgreSQL on a command line is through `psql`.
Once its command promt is up and running, try typing \d+ to list
information about databases, \du to look at existing users or \?
to list out a long list of allowed psql commands.

To create a new database, you might consider using this:

/Users/michal/Documents/journal/zettel/20210830190822-postgres-createdb
