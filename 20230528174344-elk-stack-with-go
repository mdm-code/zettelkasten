The ELK stack (from Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana) is no news, but let's put
some basic characteristics in one place for reference.

- Elasticsearch here is used here to keep data indexed for blazingly fast
search and retrieval (maybe some faceting like in Solr?)
- Logstash, unsuprisingly, is used for data pipelines and data integration
from multiple sources (logs, DBs, etc.)
- Kibana is used for visualization
