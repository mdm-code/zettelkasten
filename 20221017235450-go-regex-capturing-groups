Regular expressions in Go adhere to RE2 syntax described here:
https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax.

**Thie file linked here is generally a good point of reference.**

Notice the following elements:
- The flag `U` sets the regex to be `ungreedy` meaning that that the
  semantics of x* and x*? and x+ with x+? are swapped.
- Lookaheads and lookbehinds are not supported.
