Go vet command seems not to work well with new Go workspaces enabled for the
project. It throws some nasty errors when you try to invoke it. It works fine
with regular modules though.

The way to go about it is to slap `go work use -r .` right after you set up
your project. It will add the root directory to the go.work file, and then
everything appears to work fine.
