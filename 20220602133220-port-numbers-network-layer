For and address `127.0.0.1:8000` the first element if the Internet layer IP
address that identifies the Transport layer (TCP or UDP) host and the second
one is the port for either host-to-host communication or accessing different
services from the outside with sockets on the same host.

Port is a 16-bit number, and numbers under 1024 are considered special and require
special priviliges to use them.

```
The IP address is like a street number and the port is the number of the flat.
