There are seven layers that computers use to communicate over the network.

The tcp/ip model is simpler, but the OSI model provides better explanation of
what's going on.

In general, anything below the application layer is provided by the operating
system.

There are 7 layers of the ISO OSI model.
	=== Media layers ====
	1. The pysical layer handles bits transfered over the wire.
		- It is all the cables, electrical and optical signals, the fiber.

	2. Data link layer handles device physical addressing with MAC addresses.
		- This can often be Ethernet as a layer 2 protocol.
		- It transmits data with MAC addresses of the sender and receiver.
		- Layer 2 networks allow to broadcast frames with unknown destination.
		- This results in a broadcast to all nodes in the broadcast domain;
		  this would mean all devices in the domain and the layer 2 boundary.
		- It relies on MAC addresses that are globally unique and assigned by
		  the manufacturer. There is no way to aggregate them.

	3. The network layer handles logical addressing path determination.
		- It is based on IP addresses.

	=== Host  layers ====
	4. Transport layer takes care of connection and reliability (TCP, UDP)
	5. Session layer takes care of the interhost communication.
	6. Presentation layer handles data encription and representation.
	7. Application layer handles network process to application (HTTP, SMTP,
	FTP, POP).
