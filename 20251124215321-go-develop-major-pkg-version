# Go develop major package version

+go +repository +git +github +package +module +version +control


Whenever you're planning to introduce changes that break backward compatibility
of the code you're delivering, it has to be communicated with a major release tag.
While for some languages it's not really all that strict, with Go, it is a bit
of different story. It means you'll be branching out in the repository.

Here is a list of steps that you'd take:
1. BRANCH the repository at the latest version of the previous major version. So you'd go like
`git switch -c v2`.
2. In the checked out version, you append new major version to the module path like this
`example.com/mymodule -> example.com/mymodule/v2`.
3. In the Go code, every imported package path where you import a package from
the module gets updated:
```go
import "example.com/mymodule/package1"
# is replace with
import "example.com/mymodule/v2/package1"
```
4. Make sure that the module is available by running the `go list` command to prompt Go to
update its index of modules with information about the module you're publishing like so:
`goproxy=proxy.golang.org go list -m example.com/mymodule/v2@latest`.
