# go clear slice

The official Go wiki suggests using `nil` slices over empty ones.
Make `nil` slices the default in all kinds of interfaces as
jumping between the two will cause errors at some point.

```go
var s []int

s = append(s, 1)  // Append an element to `s`

s = nil  // Clear it by assigning `nil`
```

Empty slices are not `nil` and would return `false` in

```go
s := make([]int, 0)
s == nil  // false

s = nil
s == nil  // true
```
