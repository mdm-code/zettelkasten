# How to reset a remote repository to point to your current commit?

This is fairly straightforward. Would you do is you detach your HEAD from the
top and go back to the commit you want to revert to. This can be achieved with
`~ | ^` git checkout or reset commands.

Afterwards, the only thing you'll need to do would be to push the change up the
stream.  Here is the command you can use:

```sh
git push origin --force origin main
```
