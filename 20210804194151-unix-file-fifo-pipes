# How Unix fifo pipes work?

+unix +pipe +fifo

Named pipes are files that exist on the file system, unlike unnamed pipes
spawned with `|`. They're created with `mkfifo` command.

The operation is pretty simple, but you need to make sure that there is
the sender and receiver. Here a simple example.

In the first terminal, let's type these lines and send the output of the
`ls` command through the named pipe.

```sh
mkfifo mypipe
ls -l ~ > mypipe
```

On the other terminal, we'd have to state that we await for the input to
be piped.

```sh
cat < mypipe
```

One thing to note is that Unix pipes are much faster than files or socket.
Even though they are a file on the file system, they're not written to disk
as in the case of regular files. The system understands that the user wants
to use pipes just for communication and that there is no need for its 
contents to be saved.

And that's pretty much about it.
