# Magic Vim wands

This short is about how to run any shell command in Vim and get its output straight
into the current open file buffer.


## !! wand

The first one is two exclamation marks (`!!`).  It takes a single line as its
input and passes it to a shell command.  You press bang two times in the
`normal` mode, and then type in the name of the shell program you'd like to run
on the `ex` command window.

Here is an example of how to do it. Type in the following calculation into an
open buffer in Vi.

```sh
123 + 456 / 2
```

Then, with the cursor on this line, in the normal mode, press `!!` and type in `bc`
for a basic calculator.

The ouput that you get is the result of the calculation.

```sh
351
```

And that's basically it.


## !} wand

This wand is waaay cooler. It alows you to pass a whole paragraph as an input
to the command.  So instead of passing a single line, now you feed a whole
paragraph in. Isn't it cool?

IN FACT: The `!` bang command in normal mode works with any kind of Vim motion,
it can be G, can be 2}, whatever rocks your boat at tim time.

This means that you can run a whole script/program/whatever right from Vi.

Here is an example of Fibonacci:

```python
terms = 10

def fib(n):
	if n <= 1:
		return n
	else:
		return(fib(n-1) + fib(n-2))

for i in range(terms):
	print(fib(i))
```

And here is the input if you put your cursor on the first line of the python
code and then press `!9jpython<enter>` in the normal mode.

```sh
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
```
