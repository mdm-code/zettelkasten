Here is how to create a aggregate strings in PostgreSQL.

Mind you, in order to insert a newline character, key in `E'\n'` instead
of bare `'\n'`.

```sql
SELECT
	f.tile
	STRING_AGG(
		t."content", E"\n"
		ORDER BY t."seq"
	) FILTER (WHERE t."content" != '') AS script
FROM
	film AS f
INNER JOIN text AS t USING (film_id)
GROUP BY
	f.title
```
