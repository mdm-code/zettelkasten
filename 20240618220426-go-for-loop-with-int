# go for loop with int


+for +go +loop +int +integer +range


Starting from Go 1.22, we can now range over integers. Here is how it works:


```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	for i := range 42 {
		fmt.Printf("The value is: %d\n", i)
	}
}

Another important thing is that loop variables are no longer shared between iterations.
Finally, I can rest in peace not worrying about passing the single variable reference
to all my goroutines.
