# Adding all files recursively to Vim args

Every now and then you might want to be able to search all your files in a
directory or a directory tree. To do that in Vim, you have to have those files
open as arguments. They can be accessed by typing in `:args` in Vim.

```
:args yourProjectName/**/*.go
```

This little guy will grab all files with `.go` extension and add them to
`:args` so that they can be search through.
