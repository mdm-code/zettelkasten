# How to used `dd` to trim bytes from the start of the file

There is an easy way to remove the first *n* bytes from the start of the file
on Unix/Linux.

To strip the first 16 bytes from the `dd-in.txt` file and write it to `dd-out.txt`
file, use the following dd command syntax.

```sh
dd if=dd-in.txt of=dd-out.txt ibs=16 skip=1
```

This way, the first sixteen bytes are removed from the input file.
