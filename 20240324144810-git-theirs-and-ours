+git +checkout +merge +rebase +theirs +ours


The first and most important thing to get your head around is what is THEIRS
and what is OURS when you merge and when you rebase. The thing is the two are
going to have reverse meaning in the two cases. Ours is the branch the HEAD is
currenty pointing at. The whole confusion comes from the fact that when doing a
rebase, the HEAD is pointing at the branch you are rebasing yourself onto. Or a
detached anonymous branch to be precise. In other words, the meaning of ours
gets reversed.

In case of merge, the ours branch refers to the branch we're merging into, and
theirs stands for the branch you're merging.

When it comes to rebase, the two are reversed because when doing a rebase you
are first checking out to the branch you're rebasing onto, then you add a set
of commits on top of it. In this case, ours is the anonymous branch we're
rebasing onto, and theirs is "our" branch that is being rebased.
