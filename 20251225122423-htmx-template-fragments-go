The purpose of template fragments is to keep a template in a single file,
declare its bits as template fragments that can be then rendered. Templates
could be split across multiple files and then rendered or included as one see
fit. It means though that it might be hard to see the big picture when a
template is distributed across many files.

Here is a brief essay from the htmx website on the topic: https://htmx.org/essays/template-fragments/.

And here are implementations available for Go:
1. [stdlib with the block concept] https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#example-Template-Block
1a. [ctnd.] https://gist.github.com/benpate/f92b77ea9b3a8503541eb4b9eb515d8a
2. [templ] https://templ.guide/syntax-and-usage/fragments/

!!! A quick NOTE on the stdlib documentation: it might be clearer to have templates defined as separate
html files, and either embed them as strings or use some sort of fs mount.
