Instead of trying to fiddle with the annoying `--format` flag in both podman and
docker, it appears to be easier to use `jq` to format the JSON output whatever
way one finds it appropriate.

Here I am giving a basic example, but sky is the limit. Podman seems to give you
a default output in a form of Go struct default printf output, but JSON is way
more readable, because Go struct representation in this form does not include
field names of the struct.

```sh
podman container ls -a --format "{{json .}}" | jq ".Id"
```
