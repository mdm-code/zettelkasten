This bit here is about the usage of templates in Go. The basic elements of
templating in a programming languge covers topics such as creating a template,
injecting dynamic date into it (in Go it likely uses reflection under the
hood), utilizing complex data structures such as arrays, sliices or maps,
embedding templates in binaries.

There are two main packages in Go that handle templating:

1. One is text/template
2. There other is html/template

THE FIRST ONE (1!) CAN BE USED WHEN THERE IS NO INJECTION RISK. The second one
can be usd to format HTML pages. It includes a protection mechanism against
malicious code injected into the user input. If the goal is to generate HTML,
do use the `html/template` package instead of the text one.

DATA ENTERED BY THE USER SHOULD ALWAYS BE VALIDATED. USERS SHOULD NOT BE TRUSTED.


## Template actions

The action indicates that the system has to do something. It can either be
about data evaluation or control structures. Actions are delimited by double
curly bracers like so:

```html
<l1> The title is {{ . }} </h1>
```

In short, here the engine is asked to insert the value of the 2nd argument
passed to `template.Execute` method. ` {{ . }} `  is a template DIRECTIVE - a
part of the pseudo-scripting language.


In order to access a property on an object, one has to write a dot and the name 
of the property, e.g.:

```html
<h2> The subtitle is {{ .Subtitle }} <h2>
```


## Dot notation

INSIDE OF AN ITERATION, the dot represents the local context, and no the global one.

`.Subtitle` and `$.Subtitle` are equivalent.

Inside of an iteration the `.` dot represents the iteration local context like so:

```html
// iterate over a list of articles:
{{ range .ShoppingList }}
	<li>{{ $.Name }} {{ . }}</li>
{{ end }}
```

And then `$` is used to access the name variable existing in the global context.


## Whitespace removal

Here is the syntax for whitespace removal:

```html
// Name = "Tom"
// Gen = "'s"
<p>{{ .Name - }} {{ - .Gen }}</p>
```

The `-` minus notation removes whitespace from the left and right depending on
where its placed. It will not affect whitespace stored as a part of the
variable string value.


## Printing out dates

Let's assume that the date object stored in a database (for instance, as a full
timezone aware sql timestamp), and we want to represent it using a template.
Here is how to print out dates:

Instead of using just the dot notation, that would print out the whole timestamp
to the microsecond with the timezone, one can use the `.Format` "method" on the
date to give it a predefined format to adhere to.

```html
<p> {{ The initial date is .Date.Format "2023-02-12" }}</p>
```

The date above will get rendered as expected according to the layout.


## Nested templates

Templates can be embedded inside one another to reduce duplication and
repetition. One has to DEFINE a template before importing it and then
call it with the TEMPLATE keyword:

```html
// derived.html
{{ define "derived" }}
    <!--Content of the template named X -->
{{ end }}
...


// index.html/base.html
{{ template "derived" . }}
...
```
