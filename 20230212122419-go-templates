+go +template +dynamic +data


This bit here is about the usage of templates in Go. The basic elements of
templating in a programming languge covers topics such as creating a template,
injecting dynamic date into it (in Go it likely uses reflection under the
hood), utilizing complex data structures such as arrays, sliices or maps,
embedding templates in binaries.

There are two main packages in Go that handle templating:

1. One is text/template
2. There other is html/template

THE FIRST ONE (1!) CAN BE USED WHEN THERE IS NO INJECTION RISK. The second one
can be usd to format HTML pages. It includes a protection mechanism against malicious
code injected into the user input.
