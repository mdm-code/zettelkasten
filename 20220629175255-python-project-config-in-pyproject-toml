Here is the link to documentation:

There is now a way to configure your project in pyproject.toml file directly.
However, a lot of stuff can be moved from `setup.py` to keep it clean and simple
and allow it to used to support editable installs.

In order to install a package in an editable mode, you would keep a simple
script around:

```python
from setuptools import setup

setup()
```

And that's it; the rest is in `pyproject.toml`. The `project` table covers
most of the metadata, and configuration specific to `setuptools` are stored in
`tool.setuptools` table. Here is an example project config:

```toml
[project]
name = "manx"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A toolkit for early Middle English lemmatization."
readme = "README.md"
license = { text = "MIT" }
authors = [
	{ name = "MichaÅ‚ Adamczyk" }
]
keywords = [
	"lemmatization", "deep learning", "neural networks", "Middle English", "NLP",
]
dependencies = [
	"httpx",
	"tqdm",
	"fasttext",
	"beautifulsoup4",
]
requires-python = ">=3.10"

[project.urls]
Homepage = "https://github.com/mdm-code/manx"

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
	"pytest",
	"pytest-mock",
	"pytest-cov",
	"mypy",
	"black",
]

[tool.setuptools.packages.find]
include = [
	"manx",
	"manx*",
]

[project.scripts]
manx = "manx.console:main"
```
