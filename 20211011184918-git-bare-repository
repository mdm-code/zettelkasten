Instead of using remote services to keep your data safe, you might consider
using an external drive to store your repositories proper. Another case is when
you use a shared drive to work on some portion of code with your coworkers
without services such as Gitlab or Github or Bitbucket.

Here is how to create a bare repository on your machine from the typical one.

```sh
git clone --bare your/fancy/repo
```

Here is how to create bare repo from non-bare one:

```sh
mv repo/.git repo_bare
rm repo
git clone repo_bare repo
```

This is great and lets you work with a standard Git workflow without having to
accessing remote services.
