# podman basics

# VM in Podman Desktop

When running Podman Desktop, you want to create a Podman Machine, a VM, first with these commands:

```sh
podman machine init  # Initialize the VM
podman machine start
podman machine stop  # Stop the VM

# Cool one (here are two examples):
podman machine inspect --format '{{json .}}'
podman machine inspect --format '{{json . }}'  | jq '.ConfigPath.Path'
```

This will get your Podman machine up and running with default configuration.


# Most commonly used commands

Seems like the most commonly used commands work pretty much like their Docker 
equivalents. At least at the very basic level.

```sh
podman image pull ...
podman run
podman container  # etc. These appear to work pretty much like docker in the shell
```


# Containerfile & Dockerfile

Both Containerfile and Dockerfile names are interpreted by podman so no worries,
there's no need to rename the container blueprint in case you have strong opinion
about it.
