# podman basics

# VM in Podman Desktop

When running Podman Desktop, you want to create a Podman Machine, a VM, first with these commands:

```sh
podman machine init  # Initialize the VM
podman machine start
podman machine stop  # Stop the VM
```

This will get your Podman machine up and running with default configuration.

```sh
podman image pull ...
podman run
podman container  # etc. These appear to work pretty much like docker in the shell
```
