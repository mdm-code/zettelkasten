# js basics

# Declaring variables and comments

```js

/*
This is a
multiline comment.
*/

var x = 1;  // older syntax

let y = 2;

// constant; raises TypeError when assigning new value to constant variable.
const z = 3.17;
```


# Typing

```js
let b = 5;
typeof b;  // returns a STRING 'number'
```


# Table notation in JS

When calling methods or accessing properties on a Javascript object, it's
possible to use a rather awkward table notation. Have a look at the example:

```js
l = ['one', 'two']

l.join("+")

# The former equals the latter

l["join"]("+")
```

It applies to anything that can be accessed with the regular dot notation.
It seems like Javascript objects are maps/dictionaries underneeth the hood,
and nobody even tries to hide it.
