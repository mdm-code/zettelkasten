Vim register can be accessed with double quotes in normal mode or
by keying in Ctrl-r in insert mode (and in command mode as well).

Then you can type in the ID of the register, that is a-zA-Z0-9 or
any of the special registers that you can look up in Vim help pages.

To save something to a register, type in " followed by the register
ID. Keep in mind that that there are read-only registers in Vim, e.g.,
/, +, ; etc.
