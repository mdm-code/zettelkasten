# Regex lookahead and lookbehind

In order to wrangle the true power of regular expressions, one has to be able
to use negative and positive lookaheads and lookbehinds.  This is necessary to
capture groups of characters based on some condition.

```re
^\s*(import|from)\s*(?=.*$|.* as)(\S+ +?)*
```

This one means that you want to find all lines that start with some amount of
whitespace followed by `import` or `from` then some whitespace and all words
divided by spaces until the end of the line or the word `as`.
