It is possible to declare multiple contexts in PostgreSQL to be used in a
single expression by using the keyword `WITH` once at the start and then
separating the contexts with commas. This is how to do it:

```postgres
WITH RECURSIVE
	cte1 AS ( SELECT ... ),
	cte2 AS ( SELECT ... ),
	...
SELECT ...
```

It is important to note the keyword `RECURSIVE` that allows a `SELECT` subquery
to reference itself by name. Another benefit of using this keyword is that
queries in RECURSIVE context do have to put in order. It is impossible to do
any kind of mutual, circular recursion for obvious reasons. Without RECURSIVE,
a CTE can only access sibling CTEs that come before it in a list.
