+unix +linux +network +interface +osi


This entry describes the suite of protocols used by the
TCP/IP model.


## Datalink layer

This layer handles the physical part of sending and receiving
data over the Ethernet cable, wireless network or any other
device for that matter.


## Internet layer

This layer handles the movement of packets around the network.


## Transport layer

It offers a reliable data connection between two devices. It
splits data into packets and acknowledges packet transmission
on both sides.


## Application layer

This is the layer with applications that require network
communication like e-mail. This is the programming layer for
the most part.
