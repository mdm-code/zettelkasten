To list out all Go tools that might come in handy, type `go tool` without any
arguments, and this will give you a list like this:

addr2line
asm
buildid
cgo
compile
covdata
cover
doc
fix
link
nm
objdump
pack
pprof
test2json
trace
vet

Here is a list of useful tools that ship with Go but weren't all that known to me:

1. Nm - prints out symbols in Go binary 
2. Objdump - prints out assembly for Go code in Go binary
3. Asm - Go assembler

The rest, I kind of know about.
