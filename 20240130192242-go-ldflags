This is one cool thing that surely comes in handy when shipping go binaries to
the external repository, and you want to add some metadata to the binary, or 
maybe you want to overwrite some variables in code itself.

To do that, you can use `-ldflags` to dynamically insert data to your program
binary. Here is an example:

```go
// main.go
package main

var Version = ""

func main() {
	fmt.Println(Version)
}
```

And then, if you build it with `go build` like so:

```sh
$ go build -ldflags "-X 'main.Version=v1.0.0'" -o program

$ ./program
# Prints out: v1.0.0
```

You can inject any sort of information into your binaries with this at the build
time.
