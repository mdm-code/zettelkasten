# change open file limit unix

+unix +file +limit +ulimit

There might be the case that you run into a maxed opened file limit on unix
system.

To change the upper bound, run the following command:
```sh
ulimit -n 200000
ulimit -u 2048
```

The first one is global, the latter for the user.

These will reset with every new session, so you might want to put them in your
.rc file for shell.
