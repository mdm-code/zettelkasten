# Go monorepo workspace


+go +work +workspace +mod +monorepo


These are some thoughts on how to set up a Go project as a monorepo. The first
thing is that in the past Go had no facilities to manage multiple modules that
carry reference to each other. It had the module from, I don't know, say, Go
1.14 or something, but there was no way to have them work in a single project
as if they were packages. The Go workspace appears to do exactly that. That
said, you should in theory be able to have multiple packages in the same
directory.

You can have a single `go.work` file at the root of the project. Go is going
to complain if you try to create another one.
