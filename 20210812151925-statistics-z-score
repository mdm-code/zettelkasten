Z-score tells you how many standard deviations a data-point is from the mean.

So *Z* = (data-point - mean) / standard deviation.

The positive value tells you that the point is above average.  The negative
says it's below average. 0 means that it is close to average. If it is above 3
or below -3 it might be considered really unusual.
