# ansible create dir


+ansible


In case you want to create a directory inside of a directory that does not
exist yet, there's no need to specify that it should recurse: Ansible is going
to create it either way. I mean this kind of task:

```yml
- name: Ensure that Gh configuration directory is present
  file:
	path: "{{ gh_config_dir }}"
	state: directory
	mode: u=+rwx,g=+r-wx,o=+r-wx
```

Setting `recurse` to yes here would imply that all the files inside the dir
are going to have this exact file mode.
