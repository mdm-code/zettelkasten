# ffmpeg useful audio conversions


+ffmpeg +audio +wav +mp3 +mp4 +m4a


Most of the useful commands on channel manipulation in `ffmpeg` can be found
here:

```
https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/AudioChannelManipulation
```


You can change the number of channels and frequency with these two flags:

```sh
ffmpeg -i sample.stereo.wav -ac 1 -ar 16000 sample.mono.wav
```


This way you can specify the codec (you can pass mp3, mp4 to this command as
well).

```sh
ffmpeg -i input.wav -acodec pcm_s16le -ar 16000 -ac 1 output.wav
```


`-ac` lets you specify the number of channels, and `-ar` sets the output
frequency.


To get some information on the audio file use:

```
ffprobe sample.wav
```


Here is how to get all big- and little-endian codecs/formats for PCM:

``sh
ffmpeg -formats | grep PCM 

 DE f32be           PCM 32-bit floating-point big-endian
 DE f32le           PCM 32-bit floating-point little-endian
 DE f64be           PCM 64-bit floating-point big-endian
 DE f64le           PCM 64-bit floating-point little-endian
 DE s16be           PCM signed 16-bit big-endian
 DE s16le           PCM signed 16-bit little-endian
 DE s24be           PCM signed 24-bit big-endian
 DE s24le           PCM signed 24-bit little-endian
 DE s32be           PCM signed 32-bit big-endian
 DE s32le           PCM signed 32-bit little-endian
 DE u16be           PCM unsigned 16-bit big-endian
 DE u16le           PCM unsigned 16-bit little-endian
 DE u24be           PCM unsigned 24-bit big-endian
 DE u24le           PCM unsigned 24-bit little-endian
 DE u32be           PCM unsigned 32-bit big-endian
 DE u32le           PCM unsigned 32-bit little-endian
 ```
