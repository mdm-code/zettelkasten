Here is the guide that I based this entry on: https://makefiletutorial.com/

NOTE: The `GNU Make` is what this guide covers. Other systems should also work
just fine.


## Syntax

The syntax for a single rule (Makefile usually has more than rule) goes as 
follows:

```make
targets: requirements
	command
	command
	command
```

TARGETS are separated with spaces, so are REQUIREMENTS, but the latter have to
exist for the rule to run. COMMANDs need to start with a TAB, not spaces.

Targets are usually file names, if they exist, the rule would not be run.


## Variables

Only strings are allowed as variables, and you set them with `:=` (default),
but `=` also works well in most cases.

Variables can then be referenced using either `${x}` or `$(x)` (also $x, but
this is considered bad practice.)

E.g.:
```make
files := file1 file2

file3: ${files}
	echo "depends on: " $(files)

file1:
	touch file1

file2:
	touch file2
```
