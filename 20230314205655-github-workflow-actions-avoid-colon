+git +actions +github +gh +workflow +colon


There is an annoying bug (or is it really a bug?) in the Github workflow
file parser that does not let you use literal or even escaped, with a
slash, colon `:` outside of it default syntactic functions. In all other
places, it has to put inside quotation marks or inverted commas like so:

```yml
  name: Test formatter
  run: |
    go build -o duct cmd/duct/main.go && echo -n class A':' pass | ./duct black -l 79
```

Have a look at how it's handled in the input of the `echo` command.
