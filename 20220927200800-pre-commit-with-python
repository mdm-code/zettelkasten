Pre-commit can be annoying to install as a single callable on the system.
For me the best solution is to install it as a part of the standard development
environment alongside black, mypy and pytest. So in pyproject.toml I would
suggest writing it up like so:

```text
[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
	"pytest",
	"pytest-cov",
	"mypy",
	"black",
	"pre-commit",
]
```
