I like to use git worktree because it lets me keep a number of commits checked
out in different catalogs. I sometimes work on multiple versions of a program
at the same time, and I want to run tests, builds and whatnot without having to
configure the setup each time I clone a fresh repo at some directory.

Git worktree lets me keep track of all branches that are checked out with the
`git worktree list` command. Others are `add` and `remove`. The merges work in
the same fashion as in regular branching model, so no worries here.

You can check out a branch wherever you like on your file system. You're not
restricted by a single root directory.

Git worktree works great when you need to create a disposable copy of code to
run some tests or builds and then get rid of the code so that it does not
clutter your workspace.
