The Secure Socket Layer protocol was created by Netscape ti ensure secure
transactions between web servers and browsers. In short, this is how it works:

1. A browser requests a secure page (largely https://)
2. The web server sends its PUBLIC KEY with its CERTIFICATE
3. The browser checks that the certificate was issued by a trusted party, that
   it's still vaild and that the certificate is related to the site contacted.
4. The browser then uses the public key to encrypt a random symmetric encription
   key and sends it to the server with the encrypted URL required as well as
   other encrypted http data.
5. The web server decrypts the symmetric encryption key using its private key
   and uses the symmetric key to decrypt the URL and http data.
6. The web server sends back the requested html document and http data encrypted
   with the symmetric key.
7. The browser decrypts the http data and html document using the symmetric key
   and displays the information.
