# Basics of Linux networking


+linux +network +interface


This entry covers the basics of connecting Linux host to the network, both
local and the Internet, and to troubleshoot all things going not exactly as it
was expected.

There are two common Linux network interfaces,

	1. Loopback (lo) with an IP address of 127.0.0.1, which is exectly the IP
	address representing the host itself. This IP address is not available over
	the network.
	
	2. The ethernet 0 (eth0), typically the connection to the local network.
	Even in a virtual machine, eth0 still connects to the physical network
	interface of the host. Make sure it is UP and has an IP address assigned
	so that you can communicate with the local network and over the Internet.

Note that eth0 comes from the old naming convention, the recent standard
is described here:

## IP command

The common Linux command to configure network interfaces is

	`ip link`

By default, it shows the current status of interfacaces and their MAC
addresses.

You can use `ip link` to configure network interfaces:

	`ip link set [dev] { up | dev }` e.g. `ip link set lo mtu 1500`

In case you want to go back to the older commands like `ifconfig`, `arp` or
`route`, you can run `apt-get intall net-tools` and there you go.

For Ubuntu Docker image you might want to install it with:

```
apt install -y iproute2
```


## MAC address

It stands for a media access control address that is uniquely assigned to a
network interface at layer 2--the data link layer--of the OSI model. A network
always has, even if it does not have an IP address, one and it also called a
hardware address. It consists of six groups, two hexadecimal digits each:

	00:50:56:a3:71:f5


## IP address

They're unique on the same network and every device has at least one. One can
use `ip addr` to see the addresses of available interfaces. To verify if the
connection is up, one can use `ping`.


## DHCP
