When producing messages using Kafka client, remember that `Queue` is something
implemented in the `librdkafka` library (confluent_kafka has bindings to it.).
There is an inner `Queue` in memory that can fill itself up and error out if
the number of messages > 100k (or so -- this is the limit I hit recently.).

Call `producer.poll(0)` every call or every couple of produce calls so that
queue cleaning mechanism is triggered or else you're going to error out.

`poll()` is cheap and does not affect performance a great deal according to the
author of the library.
