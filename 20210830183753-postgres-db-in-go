# How to use Postgres database in Go?

## Package installation

The first step to use Postgres in the Go programming language is to get the
PostgreSQL Go driver package.

```sh
go get -u github.com/lib/pq
```

This is the most widely use PostgreSQL package in the Go world.


## Using in code

To use the drivers in code, you'd import them without any references to just
register the drivers. Plus, you always import the standard library package
`databases/sql` used to execute SQL statements. Here is snippet of how to do
it:

```go
package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	_ "github.com/lib/pq"
)

const (
	host = "localhost"
	user = "pguser"
	pswd = "hello123"
	dbnm = "test_db"
	port = 8080
)
```


## Establishing DB connection

Here is how to open a new database connection in Go:

```go
package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"fmt"
	_ "github.com/lib/pq"
)

sPgConn := fmt.Sprintf("port=%d host=%s user=%s password=%s dbname=%s sslmode=disable", port, user, pswd, dbnm)
db, err := sql.Open("postgres", sPgConn)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal("error raised")
}
defer db.Close()

error = db.Ping()
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
```
