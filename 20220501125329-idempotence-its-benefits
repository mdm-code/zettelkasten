Idempotence is an important concept from algebra that refers to a property of a
mathematical operation. In programming,

```
a call is idempotent if it has the same side effect each time it is called.
```

```
f(x) = f(f(x)) for every x

abs(x) = abs(abs(x)) for every real number x
```

A good example here is an assignment operation `x=1`, because no matter how many
times it is called, x will always be assigned 1. 

```
HTTP PUT, GET are also idempotent.
```

x += 1 is not idempotent because the state changes upon each new call.

BENEFITS:
- Idempotent operations are safer
	+ Retrying would not cause any problems.
- Idempotent operations are simpler 
	+ while PUT is simple, CREATE reports an error when a key exists and
	requires additional layer of error handling
- Idempotent operations are more declarative
	+ Idempotent API is focused on end-states or `what` needs to be done
	instead of `how` it has to be done.
