## Slot Error Rate (SER)

The first main metric is very similar to *F-score* in the sense that it does
not take into account correctly predicted non-punctuation boundaries, but
unlike F-score, it treats Deletion (D), Insertion (I) and Substitution (S)
equally i.e. it does not downweight D and I with respect to S. F-score
downweights S and I by a factor of two compared to S. Lastly, C stands for
correctly assigned (or agreed) punctuation marks.

Here is the equation:

```
SER = (D + I + S) / (C + D + S) * 100%
```


### CDIS (Correction, Deletion, Insertion, Substitution)

Here is an example of how to do it with punctuation:

* Alignment is counted as C (Corr) when A == B i.e. there is `,` both in A and B
* Alignment is counted as D (Del) when A != B and there is `,` in A but `[empty]` in B
* Alignment is counted as I (Ins) when A != B and there is `[empty]` in A but `,` in B
* Alignment is counted as S (Sub) when A != B and there is `.` in A but `,` in B
