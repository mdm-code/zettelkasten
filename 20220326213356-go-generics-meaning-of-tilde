The meaning of `~T` tilde in Go generics means the set of all types with
underlying type T.


```go
...

type T interface {
	~float32 | ~float64
}

type I float32
```

Here I meets the requirements of the T type constraint because it is derived
from float32. How does that interact with explicit casting and interface-driven
polimorphism?
