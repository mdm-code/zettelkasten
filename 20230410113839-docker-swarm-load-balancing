# docker swarm load balancing

I got most of the docker swarm mode figured out and practiced. One thing that I
couldn't get straight right off the bat was the routing of requests comming
over from an external client to a docker service with multiple replicas, say
five, with the same -- well obviously -- the port.

There is no need to set up a load balancer out right. The Docker default
traffic is routed using an ingress routing mesh and internal load balancer to
handle incoming requests. By default, it uses the ROUND ROBIN approach using
the container DNS records, e.g., app.1, app.2, ... , app.N

The other bit is the overlay network that spans containers-and their launched
services-across multiple nodes so that they can talk to each other. Here is how
it works on a diagram:

```txt
             swarm manager
------------------------------------
           overlay network
------------------------------------
   node1        node2         node3
------------------------------------
app db app | app app app | app db db
```
