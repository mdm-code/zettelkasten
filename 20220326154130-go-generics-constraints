In order to use constraints in your Go code, you apparently need to
pull the package off from the repo:

```sh
go get golang.org/x/exp/constraints
```

Here is a direct link to the package documentation:

```
https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/exp/constraints
```

It's not a part of the standard library, apparently.

Here is a quick reference list of types declared in the `constraints` Go library:

=   Signed  { ~int | ~int8 | ~int16 | ~int32 | ~int64 }
= Unsigned  { ~uint | ~uint8 | ~uint16 | ~uint32 | ~uint64 | ~uintptr }
=  Integer  { Signed | Unsigned }
=    Float  { ~float32 | ~float64 }
=  Complex  { ~complex64 | ~complex128 }
=  Ordered  { Integer | Float | ~string }
