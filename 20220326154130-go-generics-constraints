In order to use constraints in your Go code, you apparently need to
pull the package off from the repo:

```sh
go get golang.org/x/exp/constraints
```

Here is a direct link to the package documentation:

```
https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/exp/constraints
```

It's not a part of the standard library, apparently.

Here is a quick reference list of types declared in the `constraints` Go library.
