# $CDPATH shell variable
+shell +posix +cd

There is a better way than putting all kinds of nasty aliases for different
commonly used directories like, e.g., `cdm` for `maths` or `cdg` for `.go` etc.

Instead, you can export `$CDPATH` which works like `$PATH` for the `cd` command
and searches it for catalogs that are on the $CDPATH.

```sh
export CDPATH='$HOME:$HOME/Documents'
```

This is an ok set up as long as you symlink all the catalogs you frequent to
either your home or Documents catalog.
