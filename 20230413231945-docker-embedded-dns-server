# docker embedded dns server

+docker +container +swarm +nginx +dns +server +resolver

By default, the embedded Docker DNS server is available at 127.0.0.11.

For nginx, for instance, configured as reverse proxy, the configu might look
like this:

```
http {
	resolver 127.0.0.11 ipv6=off;
}
```

The IPv6 is disallowed here should nginx stir up troubles with using IPv6 for
DNS queries that has been known not to be forwarded to external services as of
Docker version 1.11.

Make sure the resover configuration does not get overwritten somewhere else in
the config file, like in the ones generated from the Mozilla SSL Config
Generator available here: `https://ssl-config.mozilla.org`.
