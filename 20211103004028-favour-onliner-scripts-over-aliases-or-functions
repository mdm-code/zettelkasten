# Favour one-liner scripts over aliases or functions

Any alias defined in your shell's dotfiles will not be adopted by child
processes. You won't be able to call it using Vim `!!` in normal mode or in any
subshell in general.

```sh
alias ll="ls -lahiG"
```

Any function defined like this, whether exported or not, will not be inherited
by child process, and you won't be able to call it in subshells.

```sh
ll() {
	ls -lahiG
} && export -f ll
```

You won't be able to tell what stroke you if you try to call an alias or a
function in a program, for instance, written in Python. This is going to fail
miserabely unless you define an executable one-liner script available on path.

```python3
import subprocess

subprocess.call(["ll"])
```

The same is true for JS, Perl, Go and the like.
