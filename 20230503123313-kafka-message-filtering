# Kafka message filtering


+kafka +broker +producer +consumer +partition +stream +filter +topic


Here are three options that can be used to route/filter messages across
different service Kafka consumers:

1. Kafka Streaming:
With kafka streaming you can filter data as per your need and write it to the
new topics. Consumers can consume messages from those new topics.

2. Filter Data on the Consumer Side:
You consume the data and filter the data as per required criteria on the
consumer side.

3. Use Separate partitions for separate country code:
You define total partitions of this topic as per the number of country codes
and make country code as key. Now make your consumers direct to right partition
for consuming country specific messages.

The drawback here is that you have to use a specific partition.
