By default, Treesitter command in Neovim runs asynchronously. That said, if, for instance,
you'd want to install Treesitter parsers in the Neovim headless mode with Ansible, you would
be better off using the synchronous version of the install command. Instead of doing it like
this, which is going to terminate immediately since it's async:

```sh
neovim --headless '+TSInstall all' +qa
```

You want to do the following instead:

```sh
neovim --headless '+TSInstallSync all' +qa
```

The second version is not going to terminate, and it's going to run until completion.

Another thing to remember is that arguments to Neovim commands in the command mode have to
be quoted with the command you want to run, just like in the example above.
