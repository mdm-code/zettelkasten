# python execute zip file

+python +zip +zipfile +__main__

There is a rather hacky way to make Python code pretend it's a binary. The way
to do this is to use `zipfile` Python package.

Let's assume that we got the following directory structure:

```
/app/
	__init__.py
	__main__.py
```

All of the code goes into the __main__ file. It can be anything really.
Possibly some really malicious piece of software. I can imagine it being weaved
into some jpeg because why not.  I don't whether this would work.

What would though is this:

```sh
python3 -m zipfile -c mybin.zip app/*.py
touch mybin
echo "#\!/usr/bin/env python3" >> mybin
cat mybin.zip >> mybin
chmod +x mybin
./mybin
```

This gives you a wannabe binary that might trick a five-year-old.
