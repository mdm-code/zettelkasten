NOTE: on MacOS, use macFUSE: https://osxfuse.github.io/, brew packages
are disabled unfortunately.


Sshfs needs a local directory mount point so `mkdir -p /mnt/external` first.

This is how you would mount it:

```sh
 sshfs username@remote:/remote/directory /mnt/external
 ```

And then, in order to unmount it run:

```
sudo umount /mnt/external
```
