There are a few requirements for a method to be allowed to be registered on an
RPC protocol.

A type can have any number of public/exported methods that follow the following
criteria:

* The type that is going to be registered has to be exported to start with.
* A method, obviously, has to be exported i.e. start with an Uppercase letter.
* The method should take precisely two arguments (three if the receiver counts)
and the types of these arguments should be exported as well.
* The second argument should be a pointer to a data structure whose value will
be overridden.
* The method should return an error value. If the procedure call errors out,
you'll get the error.

Here is what it ends up being:

```go
func (rt RecType) ProcMethod(p Tpayload, r *Treply) error
```
