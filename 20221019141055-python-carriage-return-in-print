# python carriage return in print


+print +python +return +carriage +sys +stdout


This snippet shows how to keep output on the same line:

```python3
import sys

for i in range(1_000):
	sys.stdout.write(f"{i}\r")
```

It's using sys.stdout instead of print, the latter adding a newline
character to the output, and a carriage return mark for consecutive
numbers to be printed on the same line in the terminal output.
