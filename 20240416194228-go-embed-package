In Go, it is possible to use the embed package to declutter your code if
you need to literally embed files into your Go codebase. In order to do
it, you have to import the embed package and then use the //go:embed
comment right above the variable you want to have the file contents to be
embedded into.

Here a short snippet showing how to use the package in code:

```go
package main

import (
	_ "embed"
	"fmt"
)

//go:embed hello.txt
var s string

func main() {
	fmt.Println(s)
}
```

You have to make sure that the file you want to embed is in the same
directory as the Go file you are working on. If you want to embed a file
from a different directory, you have to use the full path to the file,
which I would not recommmend as it makes the code less portable.
