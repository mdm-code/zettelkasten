The layer 3 networking is pretty much the default in the Linux world.

IP node relies on the neighbor table, or ARP table, to figure out how to reach
a device in the same Layer 2 and construct the Ethernet frame. If it cannot reach
out to one based on the neighbor table, the node issues an ARP request, which is
broadcast to everyone in the Layer 2 domain. The router looking out outside of the
Layer 2 domain would respond to the request asking for the MAC address of the device
with the X.X.X.X. IP address.

The default route for IP addresses that are not on the Layer 2 are sent to the default
route that can be accessed with the `ip route show` command:

```
default via 172.17.0.1 dev eth0
172.17.0.0/16 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 172.17.0.2
```

You can see the default gateway here. The ethernet network is scoped within
Layer 2 here.

There is also VLAN and the like, but I am not going to elaborate on it here.
