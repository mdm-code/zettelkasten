# How to create an enum type in Postgresql?

+sql +enum +postgres

There is a simple way to do it with the CREATE statement. Here is an exmple
with a table:

```sql
CREATE TYPE lang AS ENUM ('pl', 'en', 'de');
CREATE TABLE speaker (
	id serial,
	name varchar(333) NOT NULL,
	lang lang NULL
)
```

You would first create the enumerated type, `lang` in this case. Then you can
use it in one or more of your tables.
