# How to capture STDERR and STDOUT (possibly STDIN?)

+python +stdin +stdout +stderr +contextlib

There is no need to write a separate context manager in order to intercept FDx
in Python.  The contextlib package now offers redirect_std{out,err,in} context
manager.

The most straightforward way to use it is to write something like this:

```python
import contextlib
import sys

with contextlib.redirect_stdout(sys.stderr):
	# your code goes here
```

This will let you dodge the problem with annoying packages that have a tendency
to write some INFO output to STDOUT, for instance.
