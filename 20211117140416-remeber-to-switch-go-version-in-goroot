# remeber to switch go version in goroot

+go +version +golang

This is a personal reminder --- In case there are some problems with
non-existent packages in the standard library, it might be the case that the
version of Go is dated.

What I need to do is to switch the link `current` to the correct Go version.
Or, in case a newer version is required, install it with `go/go.sh` from my
dotfiles.
