# Calculating standard deviation (by hand)

The process is fairly straighforward. Here are the steps to take:

1. Get the mean of the dataset
2. Calculate the sum of squared distances of each data point from the mean
3. Divide the sum by the number of elements
4. Get the square root of this number
5. Finitio - that's your STDEV

Let's take a set of five data points:

1, 4, 7, 2, 6

Number of elements: 5
Mean: 4

```python
from math import sqrt
elems = [1, 4, 7, 2, 6]
mean = 4
sum = sum([(e - mean)**2 for e in elems])
stdev = sqrt(sum / len(elems))
print(f"STDEV = {stdev}")
```

The standard deviation equals 2.28 rounded to the houndredth.
