In case you forget one of two steps while recording a Vim macro, you can easily
append them at the end referencing the buffer with the corresponding capital
letter.


## Appending to the Vim register

After you're done recording a macro to "w register, you can then press @W
(notice the capital letter) to append to the "w register.


## Modifying the Vim register

You won't normally have a dedicated option, but the easiest way would be to
reassign the existing contents after some changed's been introduced. Here is
how you can do it:

```
:let @w='<Ctrl-r>w
```

This pastes the contents of the "w register and assigns it back after some
changed.
