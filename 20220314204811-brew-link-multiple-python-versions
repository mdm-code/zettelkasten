This is a boring one, but it comes right at me every now and again, so...

Here is a set of shell commands on how to install and link different Python
versions with `Homebrew`:

```sh
brew install python@3.10
brew list | grep python
brew ls python@3.10
ln -s your/path/to/python@3.10 /usr/local/bin/python@3.10
python@3.10 -m venv .
. bin/activate
deactivate
```

Most of the stuff is no news, but I just want to keep it here.
