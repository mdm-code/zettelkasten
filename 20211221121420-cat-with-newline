# cat with newline

In order to concatenate files that do not terminate with `\n` character,
iterate over globbed file names and follow the `cat` command with `echo`.

Make sure that `out.txt` does not exist prior to running this command.

```sh
for f in /**/*.txt; do (cat "${f}"; echo) >> out.txt; done
```
