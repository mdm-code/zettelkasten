Nullipotence is a function property that says that a function has no side
effects. For instance, `x=1` is idempotent, because its effect is always the
same, but it changes the state. Assigning a value to itself, for instance,
`x=x` is nullipotent because there is change of state being triggered. HTTP GET
does not change the state, so it is nullipotent.
