# How to get all parameter of a word/token in Spacy?

+spacy +feat +token +nlp +morph

To get all the interesting bits and pieces of word morphology, the lemma, the
part of speech etc., you can access Token attributes/properties.

Previously there was not `morph` attribute on Token, but now it gives you a
complete list of features attributed to a particular word.

Here is a code snippet on how to use it in Spacy.

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

doc = nlp("She sells sea shells at the sea shore.")

for sent in doc.sents:
	for word in sent:
		print("""
		sequence   = word.i
		form       = word.text
		lemma      = word.lemma_  # Without `_` gives you num. reference
		pos        = word.pos_
		tag        = word.tag_
		head       = word.head.i  # Without `.i` it's will give you the Token
		dep        = word.dep_
		morph      = word.morph
		whitespace = True if word.whitespace_ else False
		""")
```

The authors made a really good job to simplify the recovery of word attributes.
