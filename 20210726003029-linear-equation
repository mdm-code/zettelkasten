# Linear equation extension

The general equation for a line is `y = mx + b` where *m* stands for the slope and `b` stands for
the intercept. The slope defines how steep a given line is, and the intercept says where the line
crosses the origin. The slope is the change in Y over the change in X, `2y / 1x = 2`.

The extension of the equation for a line comes with a notion of hyperspace. A line is enough for
a 2D space, plane is for three-dimensional data, and hyperspace is for everything above it or for
an n-dimensional space.
